Missing features
	IMPORTANT xattrs
	IMPORTANT Compression types
	Dir index
	Blocklist ('metablock') index
	Compression options: Are these even used for anything?

Building
	README, LICENSE, manpage
	Currently on autoconf 2.68, automake 1.11: Test older versions?
	Create a separate libsquashfuse, for eg: File Roller

Features
	Support old versions of squashfs?
	Unsquashfs clone?
	Better error codes, sanity checks

Performance
	Fast bit swapping (platform specific)
	32-bit inode memory
		Currently we store a complete inode_num => inode_id table
		If export table exists, we could just use that
			Lookups could be expensive. Maybe cache as well? 
	Threading
		Parcel out blocks
		Caches are not currently thread safe
		Read metadata (eg: UIDs) in parallel?
	Delegation of caching and threading strategies
		eg: For unsquashfs, cache all inodes
	Speculative readahead?

squashfs-tools
	Submit OS X patches
	mksquashfs has a race condition on OS X
		Something to do with duplicate files?

Testing
	Known good
		Mac 10.7 amd64
		Mac 10.4 i386
		Mac 10.5 ppc
		Debian squeeze ppc
		Debian squeeze i386
		Ubuntu Lucid amd64
		FreeBSD 9.0 amd64
	Todo
		NetBSD 6 with libperfuse
		Solaris 11?
		Windows (Dokan?)
		Minix, Hurd?
		Other Linux
