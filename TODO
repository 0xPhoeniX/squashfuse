Building
	README
		Build requirements: Linux: libattr, pkgconfig
	Licensing: Make sure squashfs_fs.h use is ok
	Currently on autoconf 2.68, automake 1.11
		Test older versions?
		Other platforms?
	Create a separate libsquashfuse, for eg: File Roller
	Test suite?
	Allow specifying debug build
	Support specifying Mac OS X SDK and arch
		Why don't builds from 10.7 -> 10.4 work?

Features
	Support old versions of squashfs?
	Support LZMA1?
	Unsquashfs clone?
	High-level FUSE API?
	Code cleanup
		API design
		Better error codes, sanity checks
	Support/emulate non-prefixed xattrs?

Performance
	Profile performance
	Stack space: readdir uses too much!
	Fast bit swapping (platform specific)
	32-bit inode memory optimizations
		Currently we store a complete inode_num => inode_id table
		If export table exists, we could just use that
			Lookups could be expensive. Maybe cache as well? 
	Threading
		Parcel out blocks
		Caches are not currently thread safe
		Read metadata (eg: UIDs) in parallel?
	Delegation of caching and threading strategies
		eg: For unsquashfs, cache all inodes
	Speculative readahead?

squashfs-tools
	Submit OS X patches

Testing
	Try different block sizes?
	Known good
		Mac 10.7 amd64 (MacFUSE, OSXFUSE, fuse4x)
		Mac 10.4 i386 (MacFUSE)
		Mac 10.5 ppc (MacFUSE)
		Debian squeeze ppc
		Debian squeeze i386
		Ubuntu Lucid amd64
		CentOS 3.9 i386 (FUSE 2.5)
		FreeBSD 9.0 amd64
	Todo
		NetBSD 6 with libperfuse
		Solaris 11?
		Windows (Dokan? fuse4win?)
		Minix, Hurd?
