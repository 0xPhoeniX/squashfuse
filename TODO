Missing features
	Blocklist ('metablock') index

Building
	README
	Licensing: Make sure squashfs_fs.h use is ok
	Currently on autoconf 2.68, automake 1.11
		Test older versions?
		Other platforms?
	Create a separate libsquashfuse, for eg: File Roller
	Test suite?
	Support specifying Mac OS X SDK and arch

Features
	Support old versions of squashfs?
	Support LZMA1?
	Unsquashfs clone?
	High-level FUSE API?
	Code cleanup
		Better error codes, sanity checks
	Support/emualte non-prefixed xattrs?

Performance
	Fast bit swapping (platform specific)
	32-bit inode memory
		Currently we store a complete inode_num => inode_id table
		If export table exists, we could just use that
			Lookups could be expensive. Maybe cache as well? 
	Threading
		Parcel out blocks
		Caches are not currently thread safe
		Read metadata (eg: UIDs) in parallel?
	Delegation of caching and threading strategies
		eg: For unsquashfs, cache all inodes
	Speculative readahead?

squashfs-tools
	Submit OS X patches
