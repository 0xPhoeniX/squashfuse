For 0.1
	Separate out autoconf macros
	README
		Build requirements: Linux: libattr, pkgconfig
		Good for/not good for
		Platform
	Licensing: Make sure squashfs_fs.h use is ok
	squashfs-tools
		Submit OS X patches
	Test platforms, including squashfs-tools
	Test install

Building
	Currently on autoconf 2.68, automake 1.11
		Test older versions?
		Other platforms?
	Create a separate libsquashfuse, for eg: File Roller
	Test suite?
	Allow specifying debug build
	Support specifying Mac OS X SDK and arch
		Why don't builds from 10.7 -> 10.4 work?

Features
	Design a good API!!!
	Support old versions of squashfs?
	Support LZMA1?
	Unsquashfs clone?
	High-level FUSE API?
	Better error codes, sanity checks
	Support/emulate non-prefixed xattrs?

Performance
	Profile performance
	Stack space: readdir uses too much!
	Fast bit swapping (platform specific)
	blockidx: Create incrementally, as needed?
	32-bit inode memory optimizations
		Currently we store a complete inode_num => inode_id table
		If export table exists, we could just use that
			Lookups could be expensive. Maybe cache as well? 
	Threading
		Parcel out blocks
		Caches are not currently thread safe
		Read metadata (eg: UIDs) in parallel?
	Delegation of caching and threading strategies
		eg: For unsquashfs, cache all inodes
	Speculative readahead?

Testing
	Known good
		Mac 10.7 amd64 (MacFUSE, OSXFUSE, fuse4x)
		Mac 10.4 i386 (MacFUSE)
		Mac 10.5 ppc (MacFUSE)
		Debian squeeze ppc
		Debian squeeze i386
		Ubuntu Lucid amd64
		CentOS 3.9 i386 (FUSE 2.5)
		FreeBSD 9.0 amd64
		NetBSD 6.0 BETA i386 (puffs/perfuse)
		OpenIndiana 151a i386 (libfuse from SFE; gcc or sun cc)
		Android 2.3.3 (fuse-android, FUSE-enabled kernel)
			Use CFLAGS, LDFLAGS from fuse-android
	No low-level fuse
		Solaris 11 (uvfs/fuse): High-level sort-of works
		Minix 3.2 (puffs/refuse): High-level won't work
		Haiku (userlandfs): High-level won't work, userlandfs hard to build
		Hurd (libfuse): High-level works fine, version 2.5
		Linux 2.4.20 and earlier
			Require some fuse < 2.4.0
			High-level ok: Earlier fuse?
			LUFS?
	Known bad
		QNX 6.5 (qfuse)
			fuse_session_add_chan() crashes
			High-level crashes too
		Windows (fuse4win/dokan)
			Dokan sample bluescreens, fuse4win sample crashes
			CBFS? Totally different API, expensive
			Explorer Namespace Extension?
	No FUSE available
		DragonFly BSD - puffs is in git
		OpenBSD
		Commercial UNIX: AIX, HP-UX, etc
		iOS
	Todo
